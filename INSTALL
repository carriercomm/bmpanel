REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - imlib2
 - freetype2
 - Xlib
 - libev
 - scons and gcc 4.x.x to compile library (tested on gcc 4.2.3)

INSTALL
-------

Simple build & install (as not root user and with sudo installed, or simply run as
root without sudo):

scons && sudo scons install

Will install bmpanel to /usr/bin/panel and themes to /usr/share/bmpanel/themes.
If you don't like default prefix for install, you can specify it like this:

scons prefix=/usr/local && sudo scons install

for debug build use:

scons debug=1 memdebug=1 && sudo scons install

debug=1 currently does nothing
memdebug=1 will enable special memory management and will help you to find 
memleaks (if any).

RUNNING
-------

Simply run:

bmpanel <theme>

where <theme> is one of built-in themes or separate downloaded theme.

BMPanel have no config files, it uses theme files instead. BMPanel will search
for themes in following places in following order:

1. ~/.bmpanel/themes/<theme>
2. PREFIX/share/bmpanel/themes/<theme> 
(default: /usr/share/bmpanel/themes/<theme>)
3. <theme> (if you use absolute path)

You might want to run bmpanel in background. For example with native theme:

bmpanel native &

Don't bother to use themes as config. Just copy one of PREFIX/share/bmpanel/themes to your ~/.bmpanel/themes 
dir and change them as you want.

THEME NOTES
-----------

One thing you should know about bmpanel themes. BMPanel currently doesn't use 
xft, it uses freetype2 directly, so you MUST supply to it ttf fonts. However, 
bmpanel will try to search for them in X server's font paths. In themes
I use DejaVuSans/14, it means bmpanel will look for DejaVuSans.ttf somewhere
where your Xorg's fonts located. If you don't have DejaVuSans fonts, you
should change them to what you have.
